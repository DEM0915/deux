## Concepts
像素－图像元素，图像显示的基本单位。每一个像素是一个抽象的取样；而一个个取样点的集合则能构成一个完整的图像。

Pixel is defined as element and basic unit of image . Each pixel is an
abstract sample point ; and the collection of those sampled points can
constitute completed images.

事实上“像素”的概念并不新鲜
In fact, "pixel" concept is not new.

在漫长的人类历史中，人们一直在收集、解析和诠释像素和图像。冰河世纪欧洲的洞穴壁画被艺术和设计领域的人共同视为行业萌芽，同样的，19世纪科技发展催
生出有着浓厚像素风格的点彩画派是美术的一种新尝试，也是电视发明的一种启示。而在比特世界里，“图像”是通过计算机解读的“像素”。

In the long history of human, people always have been  collecting ,
analyzing and interpreting pixels and images. In realms of art and
design, cave paintings from Ice age in Europe are considered as the
seeds originated in art area. Similarly, the stippling painting of
strong pixel style was hastened by  science and technology in 19th
century . Gradually it has became a new attempt to fine art, as well as
an inspiration for TV invention. Meanwhile, "images" is the way how
computers interpret "pixels" upon the Bit World,

那么把像素动态视觉化，就是“梦幻像素”所表达的，它也是视觉化艺术的另一种可能。
The artwork “FancyPixel”  tries to reflect the visualization of pixels’
motions, which shows another possibility of visual art either.
